				<p>Human life is uncertain. Anything can happen to anyone at any point of time.
				 To make our life to have some security/ certainty, one needs to have
				  the Insurance which can take care of self/ family during the times of needy.</p>
				  <p>
				  	Let us take an example of a happy small family comprising of
					 Husband (bread winner of the family), wife (home maker) 
					 and 2 kids (school going students). Imagine a situation where
					  husband meets with an accident and either looses his life or his 2 limbs.
					   In this situation who will take care of the family (wife + 2 kids).
					    They were almost left in the middle of the ocean without even a life guard.
				  </p>
				  <p>
				  	In this juncture, if Life Insurance was taken by the Husband, 
					during this situation the family gets the Sum assured amount
					 from the Insurance Company which would come as a great relief,
					  and will act as a life guard for the near future.
				  </p>
				  <p>
				  	That important is Life Insurance for every individual.
					 Every Life is unique, and so it is important that 
					 every individual needs to have at least one
					  Life Insurance policy based on their earning potential.
